# C - printf

## Description
A group project replicating the printf function in C language(_printf). Using Variadic functions, structs, and multiple helper functions, the program we created will be able display inputed characters, strings, integers, and decimals (base 10). The code was made to handle all the format specifiers, but because of the simplicity of our code, we only used 5 so far. In the future, we will update the printf repository to handle more format specifiers...

### Prototype
`int _printf(const char *format, ...)`
